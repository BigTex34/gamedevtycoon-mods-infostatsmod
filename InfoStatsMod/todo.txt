Hexatan:
- Hi, I see a little think in the release details when a game are not rank (over 100) a "-1" is written.
  Nothing serious but you can add processing of this in a future release.

Haxor:
- And, can You make stats for CustomConsole, their sales, profit etc.
- And, maybe You can do that with CustomComputers too?
- And, yeah one stupid graphic bug, in consoles info, just images are out of frame.
